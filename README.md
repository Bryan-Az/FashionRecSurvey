In this repo, I summarize and tell a story of the research survey:

and Tommaso Di Noia. 2023. A Review of Modern Fashion Recommender Systems. ACM Comput. Surv. 56, 4,

Via 4 narrative artifacts:
1. A short story paper with a summary of the main scientific details within the article.
2. A (medium article)[https://medium.com/@alexyszam/how-do-contemporary-fashion-recommendation-systems-work-e9367acb07e0] that reframes the short story in a more casual tone with the gist of the article.
3. A slide-deck containing the key points of the short story, including the scientific details. 
4. A video presentation of the slide-deck.
